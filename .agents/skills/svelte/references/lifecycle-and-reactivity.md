# Svelte Lifecycle And Reactivity Patterns

Detailed Svelte 5 guidance for keyed resources, async gates, shallow aliases, finite union mapping, SvelteMap, reactive table state, and state modules.

# Prop-Keyed Resources: Let the Tree Own the Lifecycle

When a component owns a disposable resource (subscription, socket, timer, any handle with a `dispose()`/`close()`/`unsubscribe()` method) whose identity depends on a prop, open it synchronously and let the parent control mount/unmount with `{#key}` or `{#if}`. Don't store the resource in nullable `$state` and re-open it inside an `$effect`: that reimplements component mount/unmount in user-space.

## The rule

```svelte
<!-- Parent: one lifecycle boundary, structurally visible -->
{#if resourceId}
	{#key resourceId}
		<ResourceView id={resourceId} />
	{/key}
{/if}

<!-- Child: id is stable for this instance; open sync, dispose on unmount -->
<script lang="ts">
	let { id }: { id: string } = $props();

	const resource = openResource(id);
	$effect(() => () => resource.dispose());
</script>

<SomeView data={resource.data} />
```

The child's handle is non-nullable. No `{#if handle}` guard leaks into markup. The effect has one line because its only job is cleanup.

## The anti-pattern

```svelte
<!-- Reimplements mount/unmount by hand -->
<script lang="ts">
	let { id }: { id: string } = $props();
	let handle = $state<Resource | null>(null);

	$effect(() => {
		const h = openResource(id);
		handle = h;
		return () => { h.dispose(); handle = null; };
	});
</script>

{#if handle}
	<SomeView data={handle.data} />
{/if}
```

It's easy to write a double-dispose or leak here. The version above can't: the body is the cleanup.

## Decision check

1. Is the id a prop? -> Parent keys on it with `{#key}`; child opens sync.
2. Can the id be absent? -> Parent wraps in `{#if id}<Child {id} />{/if}`; child opens sync.
3. Does the component have local UI state (selection, zoom, scroll) that must survive an id swap without persistence? -> rare exception; the nullable-state pattern is justified.

## Async-gate variant

When the resource exposes a readiness promise (`whenReady`, `whenLoaded`), gate rendering in the **template** with `{#await}`. Do NOT introduce a `$state(false)` flag + `$effect` that flips it inside `.then()`: Svelte already owns promise lifecycles, cancellation, and error branching. Rebuilding that in userland is pure ceremony.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	const resource = openResource(id);
	$effect(() => () => resource.dispose());
</script>

{#await resource.whenReady}
	<div class="flex h-full items-center justify-center">
		<Spinner class="size-5 text-muted-foreground" />
	</div>
{:then _}
	<Editor binding={resource.body.binding} />
{:catch error}
	<ErrorState {error} />
{/await}
```

Bare `{:then}` is valid Svelte when the resolved promise value is unused. In this repo, use `{:then _}` for readiness gates because Biome 2.4.x currently parses bare `{:then}` as `Expected an expression, instead none was found`. Treat `_` as a temporary compatibility placeholder, not a semantic value. Use `{:then value}` only when the resolved value is actually read.

### Anti-pattern: don't do this

```svelte
<!-- Bad: Re-implements {#await} with extra state and a cancellation flag -->
<script lang="ts">
	let isLoaded = $state(false);
	$effect(() => {
		let cancelled = false;
		resource.whenReady.then(() => { if (!cancelled) isLoaded = true; });
		return () => { cancelled = true; };
	});
</script>

{#if isLoaded}<Editor />{:else}<Spinner />{/if}
```

Three problems, every time:
1. **One idea, three primitives.** A state var, a subscription effect, and an if/else branch collectively say what `{#await}` says in four lines.
2. **Silent unhandled rejections.** The `.then()` chain drops errors on the floor. `{#await}`'s `{:catch}` makes failure explicit and catchable.
3. **Manual stale-result handling.** The `cancelled` flag exists because `.then()` can fire after the branch is gone. `{#await}` keeps the pending, fulfilled, and rejected render states tied to the template branch instead of scattering that state across a flag and an effect.

### When you still need `$state` flags

`{#await}` is for **one stable promise** driving one render branch. Reach for `$state` + `$effect` only when:Wait, I think you're good now. Like you can now apply the actual fix on top.er).
- You're composing multiple promises with custom logic (race, timeout, retry).
- The flag reflects an external reactive source (`$derived(query.isPending)` from TanStack Query, a Svelte store, `createSubscriber`).

## `$state.raw` for non-proxyable handles

Svelte's deep proxy can break handles whose methods rely on `this` being the original instance, or that hold internal non-reactive state. Prefer keeping handles out of `$state` entirely (the rule above). If a handle must live in state, use `$state.raw(handle)` to skip proxying.

## Project-specific application

In this codebase, the rule applies to any component calling `*Docs.open()` (Yjs doc handles from `createDisposableCache`). Search: `$state<ReturnType<typeof .*\.open>`. Every hit is a candidate for the rule above.

## Imperative Widgets: Own The Whole Runtime Boundary

For imperative widgets such as ProseMirror, CodeMirror, maps, charts, or
canvas-based tools, prefer one component that owns the whole runtime boundary:

```txt
keyed id prop
  -> open disposable resource
  -> wait for readiness in markup
  -> construct imperative widget once
  -> destroy widget and resource on component teardown
```

Avoid splitting this into a resource component plus a one-call generic widget
component that only receives a stable handle such as `Y.XmlFragment`,
`HTMLElement`, `EditorState`, `Map`, or `Chart` config. That split usually
creates a reactive prop boundary around a value that is not application state.

Use `untrack` in a widget setup effect only for values that are intentionally
not part of widget identity, such as a stable notification callback. If you need
`untrack` for the main setup object, first ask whether the component owns the
wrong boundary. Moving ownership to the keyed child often removes the need for
`untrack` and makes the lifecycle visible in the tree.

Keep a generic widget component only when there are several real callers, a
public component API, or a non-obvious widget invariant that deserves its own
file. Otherwise, collapse the wrapper into the component that owns the resource
and mount lifetime.

# Shallow Template Aliases: Inline Direct Reads

Svelte template expressions already track reactive property reads. Do not add a `$derived` or `{@const}` whose only job is to rename a shallow property read for markup.

```svelte
<!-- Bad: the alias does not compute anything -->
<script lang="ts">
	const current = $derived(session.current);
</script>

{#if current}
	<WorkspaceGate pending={current.workspace.app.idb.whenLoaded} />
{/if}
```

```svelte
<!-- Good: read the source directly in markup -->
{#if session.current}
	<WorkspaceGate pending={session.current.workspace.app.idb.whenLoaded} />
{/if}
```

The same rule applies to block-local `{@const}` passthroughs:

```svelte
<!-- Bad -->
{#await tabManagerSession.whenReady}
	<Loading />
{:then _}
	{@const current = tabManagerSession.current}
	{#if current}
		<SignedInApp workspace={current.workspace} />
	{/if}
{/await}
```

```svelte
<!-- Good -->
{#await tabManagerSession.whenReady}
	<Loading />
{:then _}
	{#if tabManagerSession.current}
		<SignedInApp workspace={tabManagerSession.current.workspace} />
	{/if}
{/await}
```

Keep the alias when it owns real work:

- Computed predicates or values: `const isSelected = $derived(selectedId === item.id)`.
- Values used by script logic, effects, or other derived values.
- Expensive or noisy computations that should run once per block.
- Dynamic component binding: `{@const Icon = item.icon}` before `<Icon />`.
- Discriminated union payloads inside an `{#each}` branch when the alias improves narrowing and readability: `{@const bookmark = item.bookmark}`.

Searches:

```bash
rg -n '\$derived\([^)]*\.[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\)' --glob '*.svelte'
rg -n '\{@const\s+[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\s*=\s*[^}\n]+\.[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$]*\s*\}' --glob '*.svelte'
```

# `$derived` Value Mapping: Use `satisfies Record`, Not Ternaries

When a `$derived` expression maps a finite union to output values, use a `satisfies Record` lookup. Never use nested ternaries. Never use `$derived.by()` with a switch just to map values.

```svelte
<!-- Bad: nested ternary in $derived -->
<script lang="ts">
	const tooltip = $derived(
		syncStatus.current === 'connected'
			? 'Connected'
			: syncStatus.current === 'connecting'
				? 'Connecting...'
				: 'Offline',
	);
</script>

<!-- Bad: $derived.by with switch for a pure value lookup -->
<script lang="ts">
	const tooltip = $derived.by(() => {
		switch (syncStatus.current) {
			case 'connected': return 'Connected';
			case 'connecting': return 'Connecting...';
			case 'offline': return 'Offline';
		}
	});
</script>

<!-- Good: $derived with satisfies Record -->
<script lang="ts">
	import type { SyncStatus } from '@epicenter/sync-client';

	const tooltip = $derived(
		({
			connected: 'Connected',
			connecting: 'Connecting...',
			offline: 'Offline',
		} satisfies Record<SyncStatus, string>)[syncStatus.current],
	);
</script>
```

Why `satisfies Record` wins:

- Compile-time exhaustiveness: add a value to the union and TypeScript errors on the missing key. Nested ternaries silently fall through.
- It's a data declaration, not control flow. The mapping is immediately visible.
- `$derived()` stays a single expression: no need for `$derived.by()`.

Reserve `$derived.by()` for multi-statement logic where you genuinely need a function body. For value lookups, keep it as `$derived()` with a record.

`as const` is unnecessary when using `satisfies`. `satisfies Record<T, string>` already validates shape and value types.

See `docs/articles/record-lookup-over-nested-ternaries.md` for rationale.

# When to Use SvelteMap vs $state

Use `SvelteMap` when items have stable IDs and you need keyed lookup. Reads of
`get`, `has`, `size`, and iteration participate in Svelte reactivity when they
happen inside a template, `$derived`, or `$effect`. Use `$state` for primitives,
local UI booleans, and sequential data without identity.

`SvelteMap` does not deep-proxy its values. If nested fields must update
reactively, store row objects that are already reactive, mutate through the
workspace table API, or replace the map value with `set(id, next)`.

| Data Shape | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace table rows (have IDs) | `fromTable()` -> `SvelteMap` | recordings, conversations, notes |
| Workspace KV (single key) | `fromKv()` | selectedFolderId, sortBy |
| Browser API keyed data | `new SvelteMap()` + listeners | Chrome tabs, windows |
| Primitive value | `$state(value)` | `$state(false)`, `$state('')`, `$state(0)` |
| Sequential data without IDs | `$state<T[]>([])` | terminal history, command history |
| Ordered list where position matters | `$state<T[]>([])` | open file tab order |

### Anti-Pattern: $state for ID-Keyed Collections

```typescript
// Bad: O(n) lookups, coarse reactivity, referential instability
let conversations = $state<Conversation[]>(readAll());
const metadata = $derived(conversations.find((c) => c.id === id)); // O(n) scan

// Good: O(1) lookups, per-key map reactivity, stable $derived array
const conversationsMap = fromTable(workspace.tables.conversations);
const conversations = $derived(
	conversationsMap.values().toArray().sort((a, b) => b.updatedAt - a.updatedAt),
);
const metadata = $derived(conversationsMap.get(id)); // O(1) lookup
```

Three problems with `$state<T[]>` for keyed data:

1. **O(n) lookups**: every `.find()` scans the whole array
2. **Coarse reactivity**: updating one item re-triggers everything reading the array
3. **Referential instability**: sorting in a getter creates a new array every access, causing TanStack Table infinite loops

See `docs/articles/sveltemap-over-state-for-keyed-collections.md` for the full rationale.

# Reactive Table State Pattern

When a factory function exposes workspace table data via `fromTable`, follow this three-layer convention:

```typescript
// 1. Map: reactive source (private, suffixed with Map)
const foldersMap = fromTable(workspaceClient.tables.folders);

// 2. Derived array: cached materialization (private, no suffix)
const folders = $derived(foldersMap.values().toArray());

// 3. Getter: public API (matches the derived name)
return {
	get folders() {
		return folders;
	},
};
```

Naming: `{name}Map` (private source) -> `{name}` (cached derived) -> `get {name}()` (public getter).

### With Sort or Filter

Chain operations inside `$derived`: the entire pipeline is cached:

```typescript
const tabs = $derived(tabsMap.values().toArray().sort((a, b) => b.savedAt - a.savedAt));
const notes = $derived(allNotes.filter((n) => n.deletedAt === undefined));
```

See the `typescript` skill for iterator helpers (`.toArray()`, `.filter()`, `.find()` on `IteratorObject`).

### Template Props

For component props expecting `T[]`, derive in the script block: never materialize in the template:

```svelte
<!-- Bad: re-creates array on every render -->
<FujiSidebar entries={entries.values().toArray()} />

<!-- Good: cached via $derived -->
<script>
	const entriesArray = $derived(entries.values().toArray());
</script>
<FujiSidebar entries={entriesArray} />
```

### Why `$derived`, Not a Plain Getter

Put reactive computations in `$derived`, not inside public getters.

A getter may still be reactive if it reads reactive state, but it recomputes on every access. `$derived` computes reactively and caches until dependencies change.

Use `$derived` for the computation. Use the getter only as a pass-through to expose that derived value.

See `docs/articles/derived-vs-getter-caching-matters.md` for rationale.

# Reactive State Module Conventions

State modules use a factory function that returns a flat object with getters and methods, exported as a singleton.

```typescript
function createBookmarkState() {
	const bookmarksMap = fromTable(workspaceClient.tables.bookmarks);
	const bookmarks = $derived(bookmarksMap.values().toArray());

	return {
		get bookmarks() { return bookmarks; },
		async add(tab: Tab) { /* ... */ },
		remove(id: BookmarkId) { /* ... */ },
	};
}

export const bookmarkState = createBookmarkState();
```

## Naming

| Concern | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Export name** | `xState` for domain state; descriptive noun for utilities | `bookmarkState`, `notesState`, `deviceConfig`, `vadRecorder` |
| **Factory function** | `createX()` matching the export name | `createBookmarkState()` |
| **File name** | Domain name, optionally with `-state` suffix | `bookmark-state.svelte.ts`, `auth.svelte.ts` |

Use the `State` suffix when the export name would collide with a key property (`bookmarkState.bookmarks`, not `bookmarks.bookmarks`).

## Accessor Patterns

| Data Shape | Accessor | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Collection** | Named getter | `bookmarkState.bookmarks`, `notesState.notes` |
| **Single reactive value** | `.current` (Svelte 5 convention) | `selectedFolderId.current`, `serverUrl.current` |
| **Keyed lookup** | `.get(key)` | `toolTrustState.get(name)`, `deviceConfig.get(key)` |

The `.current` convention comes from [runed](https://github.com/svecosystem/runed) (the standard Svelte 5 utility library). All 34+ runed utilities use `.current`. Never use `.value` (Vue convention).

## Persisted State Utilities

For localStorage/sessionStorage persistence, use `createPersistedState` (single value) or `createPersistedMap` (typed multi-key config) from `@epicenter/svelte`.

```typescript
// Single value: .current accessor
import { createPersistedState } from '@epicenter/svelte';
const theme = createPersistedState({
	key: 'app-theme',
	schema: type("'light' | 'dark'"),
	defaultValue: 'dark',
});
theme.current; // read
theme.current = 'light'; // write + persist

// Multi-key config: .get()/.set() with SvelteMap (per-key reactivity)
import { createPersistedMap, defineEntry } from '@epicenter/svelte';
const config = createPersistedMap({
	prefix: 'myapp.config.',
	definitions: {
		'theme': defineEntry(type("'light' | 'dark'"), 'dark'),
		'fontSize': defineEntry(type('number'), 14),
	},
});
config.get('theme'); // typed read
config.set('theme', 'light'); // typed write + persist
```

Both accept `storage?: Storage` (defaults to `window.localStorage`) for dependency injection.
